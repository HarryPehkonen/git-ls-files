# git-ls-files
Proof-of-concept.  Finds all files that are under version control by Git

## Usage
```bash
$ git-ls-files
```

If you run the command in a subdirectory, it will only list files in that directory and its subdirectories.

The files need to be "add"ed to the repository -- it's not necessary to actually commit them.
